# Design Diagram for Real-Time Notification System

## Key Components

### 1. NotificationManager
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Acts as the central coordinator for handling notifications.
  - Receives notification requests from various parts of the system.
  - Delegates tasks to the NotificationService and other components.

### 2. NotificationService
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Handles the logic for creating and sending notifications.
  - Supports multiple delivery channels (in-app, email, push notifications).
  - Ensures notifications are sent according to their type (instant, scheduled, user messages).

### 3. Persistence Layer
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Manages the storage of notification data.
  - Stores information about notifications, user preferences, and delivery statuses.
  - Ensures data integrity and supports efficient querying.

### 4. Monitoring Module
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Monitors the performance and health of the notification system.
  - Tracks metrics such as delivery latency, success rates, and error rates.
  - Provides alerts and dashboards for system administrators.

## Interactions Between Components

1. **NotificationManager to NotificationService**
   - The NotificationManager receives a notification request and forwards it to the NotificationService.
   - The NotificationService processes the request and determines the appropriate delivery channel.

2. **NotificationService to Persistence Layer**
   - The NotificationService interacts with the Persistence Layer to store notification data.
   - This includes saving the notification content, user preferences, and delivery status.

3. **NotificationService to Delivery Channels**
   - The NotificationService sends notifications through the specified delivery channels (in-app, email, push notifications).
   - It ensures that notifications are delivered according to their type and user preferences.

4. **Monitoring Module to All Components**
   - The Monitoring Module collects metrics from the NotificationManager, NotificationService, and Persistence Layer.
   - It tracks performance indicators and logs any errors or issues.
   - System administrators use the Monitoring Module to monitor the health and performance of the notification system.
